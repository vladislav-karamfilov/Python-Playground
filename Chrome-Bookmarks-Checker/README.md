## Chrome Bookmarks Checker

A simple program that prints to the standard output the Chrome bookmark URL, the HTTP response status code for the request made to it and if it was a success or fail. This program can be useful for identifying and removing Chrome bookmarks that are no longer accessible on the Internet. You can also update the URL to a new one, if such exists, or make it a link to the Wayback Machine (https://archive.org/web/).
